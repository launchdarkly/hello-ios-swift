For details on Server Sent Events, see the [Specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html)

## What does it do?

It creates a long-lived, unidirectional HTTP channel between your Cocoa app and a web server so that your app can receive events from the server. 

#### Listening for Named Events

Subscribing to a _named event_ is done via the `addEventListener:handler:` method, as shown below:

```objc
NSURL *serverURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://127.0.0.1:8000/"];
EventSource *source = [EventSource eventSourceWithURL:serverURL];
[source addEventListener:@"hello_event" handler:^(Event *e) {
    NSLog(@"%@: %@", e.event, e.data);
}];
```

It's super simple and will be familiar to anyone who has seen any Server-Sent Events JavaScript code.

#### Listening for All Events

There's a `onMessage:` method that will receive all message events from the server. 

```objc
NSURL *serverURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://127.0.0.1:8000/"];
EventSource *source = [EventSource eventSourceWithURL:serverURL];
[source onMessage:^(Event *e) {
    NSLog(@"%@: %@", e.event, e.data);
}];
```

#### Listening for Connection State Changes

Additionally, there are `onOpen:`, `onMessage`, `onError:`, and `onReadyStateChanged:` methods to receive connection state events.

```objc
NSURL *serverURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://127.0.0.1:8000/"];
EventSource *source = [EventSource eventSourceWithURL:serverURL];
[source onError:^(Event *e) {
    NSLog(@"ERROR: %@", e.data);
}];
```

With the exception of the `onError:`, the `event` and `data` properties for these events will be `null`. Check the `readyState` property on the event. 

#### Graceful Connection Handling

To make the initial connection to the streaming event server, call `open` on the event source. That gives you control over when events start arriving.

```objc
NSURL *serverURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://127.0.0.1:8000/"];
EventSource *source = [EventSource eventSourceWithURL:serverURL];
[source onMessage:^(Event *e) {
    NSLog(@"%@: %@", e.event, e.data);
}];
[source open];
```

Reconnection attempts are automatic and seamless, even if the server goes down. How frequently reconnection attempts are made is controlled by the server by setting the `retry` key on its events. If the server doesn't send a retry, the default is 1 second intervals. 

### Server Code

This is a simple [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) app that will generate the Server-Sent Events. The events are created at a rate of one per second.

```
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked', 'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream' });
 
    setInterval(function() { 
        var now = new Date().getTime();
        var payload = 'event: hello_event\ndata: {"message":"' + now + '"}\n\n'; 
        res.write(payload); 
    }, 1000);
}).listen(8000);
```

The payload above doesn't include an `id` parameter, but if you include one it will be available in the `Event` object in your Cocoa code.

## Installation
EventSource supports multiple methods for installing the library in a project.

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like EventSource in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```
#### Podfile

To integrate EventSource into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'TargetName' do
pod 'DarklyEventSource', '~> 4.0.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate EventSource into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "launchdarkly/ios-eventsource" >= 4.0.0
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `EventSource.framework` into your Xcode project.
