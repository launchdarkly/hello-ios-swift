Installation
------------

LaunchDarkly supports multiple methods for installing the library in a project.

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like LaunchDarkly in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```
#### Podfile

To integrate LaunchDarkly into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'TargetName' do
pod 'LaunchDarkly'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate LaunchDarkly into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "launchdarkly/ios-client" "2.13.5"
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `Darkly.framework` into your Xcode project.

Quick setup
-----------

1. Add the SDK to your `Podfile`:

        pod 'LaunchDarkly', '2.13.5'

2. Import the LaunchDarkly client:

        #import "Darkly.h"

3. Instantiate a new LDClient with your mobile key and user:

        LDConfig *config = [[LDConfig alloc] initWithMobileKey: @"YOUR_MOBILE_KEY"];

        LDUserBuilder *user = [[LDUserBuilder alloc] init];
        user.key = @"aa0ceb";

        [[LDClient sharedInstance] start:config withUserBuilder:user];

(Be sure to use a mobile key from your environments. Never embed a standard SDK key into a mobile application.)

Your first feature flag
-----------

1. Create a new feature flag on your dashboard

2. In your application code, use the feature’s key to check whether the flag is on for each user:

        BOOL showFeature = [[LDClient sharedInstance] boolVariation:@"YOUR_FLAG_KEY" fallback:NO];
        if (showFeature) {
                NSLog(@"Showing feature for %@", user.key);
        } else {
                NSLog(@"Not showing feature for user %@", user.key);
        }

Manage the feature on your dashboard — control who sees the feature without re-deploying your application!

Check out our [documentation](http://docs.launchdarkly.com) for in-depth instructions on configuring and using LaunchDarkly. You can also head straight to the [complete reference guide for this SDK](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/ios-sdk-reference).

Testing
-------

We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test for consistency across SDKs, as well as test networking behavior in a long-running application. These tests cover each method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all behave correctly.

About LaunchDarkly
-----------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
