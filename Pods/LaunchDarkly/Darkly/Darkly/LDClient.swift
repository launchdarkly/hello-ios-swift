/**
 The LDClient is the heart of the SDK, providing client apps running iOS, watchOS, macOS, or tvOS access to LaunchDarkly services. This singleton provides the ability to set a configuration (LDConfig) that controls how the LDClient talks to LaunchDarkly servers, and a user (LDUser) that provides finer control on the feature flag values delivered to LDClient. Once the LDClient has started, it connects to LaunchDarkly's servers to get the feature flag values you set in the Dashboard.
## Usage
### Startup
 1. To customize, configure a `LDConfig` and `LDUser`. The `config` is required, the `user` is optional. Both give you additional control over the feature flags delivered to the LDClient. See `LDConfig` & `LDUser` for more details.
    - The mobileKey set into the `LDConfig` comes from your LaunchDarkly Account settings (on the left, at the bottom). If you have multiple projects be sure to choose the correct Mobile key.
 2. Call `LDClient.shared.start(config: user: completion:)`
    - If you do not pass in a LDUser, LDCLient will create a default for you.
    - The optional completion closure allows the LDClient to notify your app when it has gone online.
 3. Because the LDClient is a singleton, you do not have to keep a reference to it in your code.

### Getting Feature Flags
 Once the LDClient has started, it makes your feature flags available using the `variation` and `variationAndSource` methods. A `variation` is a specific flag value. For example a boolean feature flag has 2 variations, `true` and `false`. You can create feature flags with more than 2 variations using other feature flag types. See `LDFlagValue` for the available types.
 ````
 let boolFlag = LDClient.shared.variation(forKey: "my-bool-flag", fallback: false)
 ````
 If you need to know the source of the variation provided to you for a specific feature flag, the `variationAndSource` method returns a tuple with the (value, source) in a single call.

 See `variation(forKey: fallback:)` or `variationAndSource(forKey: fallback:)` for details

### Observing Feature Flags
 You might need to know when a feature flag value changes. This is not required, you can check the flag's value when you need it.

 If you want to know when a feature flag value changes, you can check the flag's value. You can also use one of several `observe` methods to have the LDClient notify you when a change occurs. There are several options--you can set up notificiations based on when a specific flag changes, when any flag in a collection changes, or when a flag doesn't change.
 ````
 LDClient.shared.observe("flag-key", owner: self, observer: { [weak self] (changedFlag) in
    self?.updateFlag(key: "flag-key", changedFlag: changedFlag)
 }
 ````
 The `changedFlag` passed in to the closure contains the old and new value, and the old and new valueSource.

If you try to share feature flags between apps, the latest flag values may be overwritten by old feature flags from the other platform.

     When offline, the SDK does not attempt to communicate with LaunchDarkly servers. Client apps can request feature flag values and set/change feature flag observers while offline. The SDK will collect events while offline.

     The SDK protects itself from multiple rapid calls to setOnline(true) by enforcing an increasing delay (called *throttling*) each time setOnline(true) is called within a short time. The first time, the call proceeds normally. For each subsequent call the delay is enforced, and if waiting, increased to a maximum delay. When the delay has elapsed, the `setOnline(true)` will proceed, assuming that the client app has not called `setOnline(false)` during the delay. Therefore a call to setOnline(true) may not immediately result in the LDClient going online. Client app developers should consider this situation abnormal, and take steps to prevent the client app from making multiple rapid setOnline(true) calls. Calls to setOnline(false) are not throttled. Note that calls to `start(config: user: completion:)`, and setting the `config` or `user` can also call `setOnline(true)` under certain conditions. After the delay, the SDK resets and the client app can make a susequent call to setOnline(true) without being throttled.

     Client apps can set a completion closure called when the setOnline call completes. For unthrottled `setOnline(true)` and all `setOnline(false)` calls, the SDK will call the closure immediately on completion of this method. For throttled `setOnline(true)` calls, the SDK will call the closure after the throttling delay at the completion of the setOnline method.

     The SDK will not go online if the client has not been started, or the `mobileKey` is empty. For macOS, the SDK will not go online in the background unless `enableBackgroundUpdates` is true.

     Use `isOnline` to get the online/offline state.

     When asked for a variation value, the LDClient provides either the value, or the value and LDVariationSource as a tuple.
    */
    
    /**
     Returns the variation for the given feature flag. If the flag does not exist, cannot be cast to the correct return type, or the LDClient is not started, returns the fallback value. Use this method when the fallback value is a non-Optional type. See `variation` with the Optional return value when the fallback value can be nil.

     A *variation* is a specific flag value. For example a boolean feature flag has 2 variations, *true* and *false*. You can create feature flags with more than 2 variations using other feature flag types. See `LDFlagValue` for the available types.

     The LDClient must be started in order to return feature flag values. If the LDClient is not started, it will always return the fallback value. The LDClient must be online to keep the feature flag values up-to-date.

     When online, the LDClient has two modes for maintaining feature flag values: *streaming* and *polling*. The client app requests the mode by setting the `config.streamingMode`, see `LDConfig` for details.
     - In streaming mode, the LDClient opens a long-running connection to LaunchDarkly's streaming server (called *clientstream*). When a flag value changes on the server, the clientstream notifies the SDK to update the value. Streaming mode is not available on watchOS. On iOS and tvOS, the client app must be running in the foreground to connect to clientstream. On macOS the client app may run in either foreground or background to connect to clientstream. If streaming mode is not available, the SDK reverts to polling mode.
     - In polling mode, the LDClient requests feature flags from LaunchDarkly's app server at regular intervals defined in the LDConfig. When a flag value changes on the server, the LDClient will learn of the change the next time the SDK requests feature flags.

     When offline, LDClient closes the clientstream connection and no longer requests feature flags. The LDClient will return feature flag values (assuming the LDClient was started), which may not match the values set on the LaunchDarkly server.

     A call to `variation` records events reported later. Recorded events allow clients to analyze usage and assist in debugging issues.

     ### Usage

     let boolFeatureFlagValue = LDClient.shared.variation(forKey: "bool-flag-key", fallback: false) //boolFeatureFlagValue is a Bool
     ````
     **Important** The fallback value tells the SDK the type of the feature flag. In several cases, the feature flag type cannot be determined by the values sent from the server. It is possible to provide a fallback value with a type that does not match the feature flag value's type. The SDK will attempt to convert the feature flag's value into the type of the fallback value in the variation request. If that cast fails, the SDK will not be able to determine the correct return type, and will always return the fallback value.

     Pay close attention to the type of the fallback value for collections. If the fallback collection type is more restrictive than the feature flag, the sdk will return the fallback even though the feature flag is present because it cannot convert the feature flag into the type requested via the fallback value. For example, if the feature flag has the type `[LDFlagKey: Any]`, but the fallback has the type `[LDFlagKey: Int]`, the sdk will not be able to convert the flags into the requested type, and will return the fallback value.

     To avoid this, make sure the fallback type matches the expected feature flag type. Either specify the fallback value type to be the feature flag type, or cast the fallback value to the feature flag type prior to making the variation request. In the above example, either specify that the fallback value's type is [LDFlagKey: Any]:
     ````
     let fallbackValue: [LDFlagKey: Any] = ["a": 1, "b": 2]     //dictionary type would be [String: Int] without the type specifier
     ````

     ````

     ````

     - parameter fallback: The fallback value to return if the feature flag key does not exist.

If that cast fails, the SDK will not be able to determine the correct return type, and will always return the fallback value.

     When specifying `nil` as the fallback value, the compiler must also know the type of the optional. Without this information, the compiler will give the error "'nil' requires a contextual type". There are several ways to provide this information, by setting the type on the item holding the return value, by casting the return value to the desired type, or by casting `nil` to the desired type. We recommend following the above example and setting the type on the return value item.

     For this method, the fallback value is defaulted to `nil`, allowing the call site to omit the fallback value.

If the fallback collection type is more restrictive than the feature flag, the sdk will return the fallback even though the feature flag is present because it cannot convert the feature flag into the type requested via the fallback value.

If the flag does not exist, cannot be cast to the correct return type, or the LDClient is not started, returns the fallback value and `.fallback` for the source. Use this method when the fallback value is a non-Optional type. See `variationAndSource` with the Optional return value when the fallback value can be nil.

     A *variation* is a specific flag value. For example a boolean feature flag has 2 variations, *true* and *false*. You can create feature flags with more than 2 variations using other feature flag types. See `LDFlagValue` for the available types.

     The LDClient must be started in order to return feature flag values. If the LDClient is not started, it will always return the fallback value. The LDClient must be online to keep the feature flag values up-to-date.

     When online, the LDClient has two modes for maintaining feature flag values: *streaming* and *polling*. The client app requests the mode by setting the `config.streamingMode`, see `LDConfig` for details.
     - In streaming mode, the LDClient opens a long-running connection to LaunchDarkly's streaming server (called *clientstream*). When a flag value changes on the server, the clientstream notifies the SDK to update the value. Streaming mode is not available on watchOS. On iOS and tvOS, the client app must be running in the foreground to connect to clientstream. On macOS the client app may run in either foreground or background to connect to clientstream. If streaming mode is not available, the SDK reverts to polling mode.
     - In polling mode, the LDClient requests feature flags from LaunchDarkly's app server at regular intervals defined in the LDConfig. When a flag value changes on the server, the LDClient will learn of the change the next time the SDK requests feature flags.

     When offline, LDClient closes the clientstream connection and no longer requests feature flags. The LDClient will return feature flag values (assuming the LDClient was started), which may not match the values set on the LaunchDarkly server.

     A call to `variationAndSource` records events reported later. Recorded events allow clients to analyze usage and assist in debugging issues.

     ### Usage
     ````
     let (boolFeatureFlagValue, boolFeatureFlagSource) = LDClient.shared.variationAndSource(forKey: "bool-flag-key", fallback: false)    //boolFeatureFlagValue is a Bool
     ````
     **Important** The fallback value tells the SDK the type of the feature flag. In several cases, the feature flag type cannot be determined by the values sent from the server. It is possible to provide a fallback value with a type that does not match the feature flag value's type. The SDK will attempt to convert the feature flag's value into the type of the fallback value in the variation request. If that cast fails, the SDK will not be able to determine the correct return type, and will always return the fallback value.

     Pay close attention to the type of the fallback value for collections. If the fallback collection type is more restrictive than the feature flag, the sdk will return the fallback even though the feature flag is present because it cannot convert the feature flag into the type requested via the fallback value. For example, if the feature flag has the type `[LDFlagKey: Any]`, but the fallback has the type `[LDFlagKey: Int]`, the sdk will not be able to convert the flags into the requested type, and will return the fallback value.

     To avoid this, make sure the fallback type matches the expected feature flag type. Either specify the fallback value type to be the feature flag type, or cast the fallback value to the feature flag type prior to making the variation request. In the above example, either specify that the fallback value's type is [LDFlagKey: Any]:
     ````
     let fallbackValue: [LDFlagKey: Any] = ["a": 1, "b": 2]     //dictionary type would be [String: Int] without the type specifier
     ````
     or cast the fallback value into the feature flag type prior to calling variation:
     ````
     let (dictionaryFlagValue, dictionaryFeatureFlagSource) = LDClient.shared.variationAndSource(forKey: "dictionary-key", fallback: ["a": 1, "b": 2] as [LDFlagKey: Any])  //cast always succeeds since the destination type is less restrictive
     ````

     - parameter forKey: The LDFlagKey for the requested feature flag.
     - parameter fallback: The fallback value to return if the feature flag key does not exist.

     - returns: A tuple containing the requested feature flag value and source, or the fallback if the flag is missing or cannot be cast to the fallback type, or the client is not started. If the fallback value is returned, the source is `.fallback`

     **Important** The fallback value tells the SDK the type of the feature flag. In several cases, the feature flag type cannot be determined by the values sent from the server. It is possible to provide a fallback value with a type that does not match the feature flag value's type. The SDK will attempt to convert the feature flag's value into the type of the fallback value in the variation request. If that cast fails, the SDK will not be able to determine the correct return type, and will always return the fallback value.

     When specifying `nil` as the fallback value, the compiler must also know the type of the optional. Without this information, the compiler will give the error "'nil' requires a contextual type". There are several ways to provide this information, by setting the type on the item holding the return value, by casting the return value to the desired type, or by casting `nil` to the desired type. We recommend following the above example and setting the type on the return value item.

     For this method, the fallback value is defaulted to `nil`, allowing the call site to omit the fallback value.

     Pay close attention to the type of the fallback value for collections. If the fallback collection type is more restrictive than the feature flag, the sdk will return the fallback even though the feature flag is present because it cannot convert the feature flag into the type requested via the fallback value.

    // MARK: Feature Flag Updates
    
    /* FF Change Notification
     Conceptual Model
     LDClient keeps a list of two types of closure observers, either Flag Change Observers or Flags Unchanged Observers.
     There are 3 types of Flag Change Observers, Individual Flag Change Observers, Flag Collection Change Observers, and All Flags Change Observers. LDClient executes Individual Flag observers when it detects a change to a single flag being observed. LDClient executes Flag Collection Change Observers one time when it detects a change to any flag in the observed flag collection. LDClient executes All Flags observers one time when it detects a change to any flag. The Individual Flag Change Observer has closure that takes a LDChangedFlag input parameter which communicates the flag's old & new value. Flag Collection and All Flags Observers will have a closure that takes a dictionary of [LDFlagKey: LDChangeFlag] that communicates all of the changed flags.
     An app registers an Individual Flag observer using observe(key:, owner:, handler:). An app registers a Flag Collection Observer using observe(keys: owner: handler), An app registers an All Flags observer using observeAll(owner:, handler:). An app can register multiple closures for each type by calling these methods multiple times. When the value of a flag changes, LDClient calls each registered closure 1 time.
     Flags Unchanged Observers allow the LDClient to communicate to the app when it receives flags from the LD server that doesn't change any values from what the LDClient had already. For example, at launch the LDClient restores cached flag values before requesting flags from the LD server. If there has been no change to the flag values, the LDClient will execute the Flags Unchanged Observers that the app has registered. An app registers a Flags Unchanged Observer using observeFlagsUnchanged(owner: handler:).
     LDClient will automatically remove observers when the owner is nil. This means an app does not need to stop observing flags, the LDClient will remove the observer after it has gone out of scope. An app can stop observers explicitly using stopObserver(owner:).
     LDClient executes observers on the main thread.
