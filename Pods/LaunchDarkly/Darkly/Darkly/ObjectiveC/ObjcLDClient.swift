/**
 The LDClient is the heart of the SDK, providing client apps running iOS, watchOS, macOS, or tvOS access to LaunchDarkly services. This singleton provides the ability to set a configuration (LDConfig) that controls how the LDClient talks to LaunchDarkly servers, and a user (LDUser) that provides finer control on the feature flag values delivered to LDClient. Once the LDClient has started, it connects to LaunchDarkly's servers to get the feature flag values you set in the Dashboard.

 ### Objc Classes
 The SDK creates an Objective-C native style API by wrapping Swift specific classes, properties, and methods into Objective-C wrapper classes prefixed by `Objc`. By defining Objective-C specific names, client apps written in Objective-C can use a native coding style, including using familiar LaunchDarkly SDK names like `LDClient`, `LDConfig`, and `LDUser`. Objective-C developers should refer to the Objc documentation by following the Objc specific links following type, property, and method names.
 ## Usage
 ### Startup
 1. To customize, configure a LDConfig (`ObjcLDConfig`) and LDUser (`ObjcLDUser`). The `config` is required, the `user` is optional. Both give you additional control over the feature flags delivered to the LDClient. See `ObjcLDConfig` & `ObjcLDUser` for more details.
 - The mobileKey set into the `LDConfig` comes from your LaunchDarkly Account settings (on the left, at the bottom). If you have multiple projects be sure to choose the correct Mobile key.
 2. Call `[LDClient.sharedInstance startWithConfig: user: completion:]` (`ObjcLDClient.startWithConfig(_:config:user:completion:)`)
 - If you do not pass in a LDUser, LDCLient will create a default for you.
 - The optional completion closure allows the LDClient to notify your app when it has gone online.
 3. Because the LDClient is a singleton, you do not have to keep a reference to it in your code.

 ### Getting Feature Flags
 Once the LDClient has started, it makes your feature flags available using the `variation` and `variationAndSource` methods. A `variation` is a specific flag value. For example, a boolean feature flag has 2 variations, `YES` and `NO`. You can create feature flags with more than 2 variations using other feature flag types. See `LDFlagValue` for the available types.
 ````
 BOOL boolFlag = [LDClient.sharedInstance boolVariationForKey:@"my-bool-flag" fallback:NO];
 ````
 If you need to know the source of the variation provided to you for a specific feature flag, the typed `variationAndSource` methods return a LDVariationValue with the value & source in a single call.
 ````
 LDBoolVariationValue *boolVariationValue = [LDClient.sharedInstance boolVariationAndSourceForKey:@"my-bool-flag" fallback:NO];
 BOOL boolFlag = boolVariationValue.value;
 LDFlagValueSource boolFlagSource = boolVariationValue.source;
 ````

 See the typed `-[LDCLient variationForKey: fallback:]` or `-[LDClient variationAndSourceForKey: fallback:]` methods in the section **Feature Flag values** for details.

 ### Observing Feature Flags
 If you want to know when a feature flag value changes, you can check the flag's value. You can also use one of several `observe` methods to have the LDClient notify you when a change occurs. There are several options-- you can setup notifications based on when a specific flag changes, when any flag in a collection changes, or when a flag doesn't change.
 ````
 __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
 [LDClient.sharedInstance observeBool:@"my-bool-flag" owner:self handler:^(LDBoolChangedFlag *changedFlag) {
    __strong typeof(weakSelf) strongSelf = weakSelf;
    [strongSelf updateFlagWithKey:@"my-bool-flag" changedFlag:changedFlag];
 }];
 ````
 The `changedFlag` passed in to the block contains the old and new value, and the old and new valueSource. See the typed `LDChangedFlag` classes in the **Obj-C Changed Flags**.

     A *variation* is a specific flag value. For example a boolean feature flag has 2 variations, *true* and *false*. You can create feature flags with more than 2 variations using other feature flag types. See `LDFlagValue` for the available types.

     The LDClient must be started in order to return feature flag values. If the LDClient is not started, it will always return the fallback value. The LDClient must be online to keep the feature flag values up-to-date.

     When offline, LDClient closes the clientstream connection and no longer requests feature flags. The LDClient will return feature flag values (assuming the LDClient was started), which may not match the values set on the LaunchDarkly server.

    // MARK: - Events

    /**
     Adds a custom event to the LDClient event store. A client app can set a tracking event to allow client customized data analysis. Once an app has called `trackEvent`, the app cannot remove the event from the event store.

     LDClient periodically transmits events to LaunchDarkly based on the frequency set in LDConfig.eventFlushInterval. The LDClient must be started and online. Ths SDK stores events tracked while the LDClient is offline, but started.

     Once the SDK's event store is full, the SDK discards events until they can be reported to LaunchDarkly. Configure the size of the event store using `eventCapacity` on the `config`. See `LDConfig` (`ObjcLDConfig`) for details.

     ### Usage
     ````
     [LDClient.sharedInstance trackEventWithKey:@"event-key" data:@{@"event-data-key":7}];
     ````

     - parameter key: The key for the event. The SDK does nothing with the key, which can be any string the client app sends
     - parameter data: The data for the event. The SDK does nothing with the data, which can be any valid JSON item the client app sends. (Optional)
     - parameter error: NSError object to hold the invalidJsonObject error if the data is not a valid JSON item. (Optional)
